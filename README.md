## Trojan.VBS.Joke

A cool little "program" made in Visual Basic Script and HTML that disables you computer and never lets you disable it. Main payloads: denial of service, hiding all your user files, changing all you user shortcuts to itself, changing your wallpaper, and blasts Rebecca Black's Friday on loop.

### Some info on the version names and such
#### Trojan.VBS.Joke
First Word: Type of malware: There are 3 different types, worms, trojans, and viruses. Worms spread through email and such, trojans don't spread but come from downloads and stuff, viruses replicate themselves.
Second Word: Scripting language: Basically the scripting language that the program is written in.
Third Word: Program name
#### v(number).(number)
Version number
#### Semi-lethal/Lethal/Non-lethal
How destructive the program is: Semi lethal means that some modifications are done, and does some damage, but the computer is still usable. Lethal is computer going boom boom (no more use afterwards), and non-lethal is that it doesn't do any real damage. 
#### Conrad/Mohorovičić/Gutenberg/Super-Lehmann
The class of the program, gaging how severe it is. Like, how fast it can spread, the lethality, so on, so forth. This program is Gutenberg class
